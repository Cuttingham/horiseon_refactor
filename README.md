<h1><b>Horiseon Refactor</b></h1>

<p>This project is a code refactor for the Horiseon website homepage. The purposes of this refactoring is to make the previous code more efficient, comprehensible and accessible. This refactoring should also result in improved accesibility and optimise the page for search engines. The modification does not change the displayed styling of the page, only the underlying code. </p>

## User Story 

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

* WHEN I view the source code
* THEN I find semantic HTML elements
* WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
* THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* WHEN I view the icon and image elements
* THEN I find accessible alt attributes
* WHEN I view the heading attributes
* THEN they fall in sequential order
* WHEN I view the title element
* THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Tasks Completed

* Added alt text on images and icons for SEO and accessibility;
* Explanatory comments were provided in the HTML document;
